Hi, this is a Youtube clone made using Rapid api. Since there can be only limited requests to the api, I have added an extra key if in case the number of requests are exhausted (you will get an error with a status code of 429 in the console). Just replace the 'VITE_APP_RAPID_API_KEY2' in fetchFromApi.js inside the utils folder with 'VITE_APP_RAPID_API_KEY2'.
Thank You!
